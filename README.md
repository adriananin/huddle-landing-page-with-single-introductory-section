- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The position of a background image can be changed
- The fill of an svg can be changed directly on the svg.
- SVG viewbox attribute helps define what part of the SVG should be visible when someone views it on their browser.

### Continued development

- A Tablet specific version of this page can be added in the future
